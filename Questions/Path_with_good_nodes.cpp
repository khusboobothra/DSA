/*Given a tree with N nodes labelled from 1 to N.

Each node is either good or bad denoted by binary array A of size N where if A[i] is 1 then ithnode is good else if A[i] is 
0 then ith node is bad.
Also the given tree is rooted at node 1 and you need to tell the number of root to leaf paths in the tree that contain not more than C good nodes.

NOTE:
Each edge in the tree is bi-directional.*/
